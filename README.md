# FileSync
FileSync is a very basic WPF application for the bulk copying of files and folders to a different location.

Originally designed to help a family member synchronize their music files with their Android device.

### Features
FileSync allows you to select individual files or even entire folders you wish to copy.

FileSync gives you three options when it comes to overwriting files that already exist in the 
destination directory: None, New, or All.

1. None - If a file with the same name already exists in the destination directory, FileSync will not make a copy.
1. New - If a file with the same name already exists in the destination directory, FileSync will only overwrite it if it is an older version.
1. All - FileSync will copy all files, regardless of any existing files.

### Use
1. Use the "Files" or "Folder(s)" button to select one or more files or folders, respectively, and FileSync will
list all the selected files along with their full path.

1. Use the slider at the top to select the method of copying: None, New, or All.

1. Click the "Sync" button and select a destination.

That's it!

Granted, this isn't difficult to do on your own, but it makes it easy to copy large amounts of files between devices without having to worry about which files to overwrite, if needed.
